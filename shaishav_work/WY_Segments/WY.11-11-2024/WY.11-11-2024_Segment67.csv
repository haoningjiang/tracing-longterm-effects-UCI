You know you you have some kind of intellectual property that you've developed, and you're trying to scale right? And so",WY.11-11-2024,331,Reference
Michelle Sullivan,00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:47.350,how is it that you're what how do you continue to keep your brand and scale in ways that are not,WY.11-11-2024,332,Reference
Michelle Sullivan,00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:53.910,"quite right for that rural frontier context? But, by golly.",WY.11-11-2024,333,Reference
Michelle Sullivan,00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.520,that's what you've developed. And that's what's gonna remain. So.,WY.11-11-2024,334,Reference
Seth Corrigan,00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:10.989,"That's so great. That's so helpful. We so on the competition side of things, that's absolutely part of what motivates our work here with you all is figuring out how to turn it into less of a 0 sum game",WY.11-11-2024,335,Reference

Seth Corrigan,00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:20.159,But I don't think in any of our conversations. We've accounted for the control or dilution ideas.,WY.11-11-2024,337,Coding
Emily,00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:21.340,And so.,WY.11-11-2024,338,Coding
Seth Corrigan,00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:25.739,That's really helpful. So that's another part of the puzzle that maybe has to be accounted for.,WY.11-11-2024,339,Coding
Michelle Sullivan,00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:41.069,"Yeah. And I wouldn't say, like in our case, I don't know that we have context. I think it may be a difference in in kind of rural communities. There's not necessarily a competition for students. It's it's, in fact, the opposite where you have",WY.11-11-2024,340,Coding

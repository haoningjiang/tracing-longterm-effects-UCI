Emily Vercoe,00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.620,I would think that's probably gonna be,WY.10-03-2024,253,Reference
Emily Vercoe,00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:59.549,"chronological, too, as we go through the school year prepping for summer, our big initiatives coming in the summer",WY.10-03-2024,254,Reference
Emily Vercoe,00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.480,working with our fellows from college. I think that,WY.10-03-2024,255,Reference
Emily Vercoe,00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:09.839,our work really probably does have a bit of an ebb and flow with the kinds of organizations,WY.10-03-2024,256,Coding

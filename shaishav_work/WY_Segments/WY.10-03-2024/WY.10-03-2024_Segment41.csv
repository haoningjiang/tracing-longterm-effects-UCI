Seth Corrigan,00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.269,"okay, so I kind of.",WY.10-03-2024,204,Reference
Emily Vercoe,00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:07.380,"Started on page 3, fleshing out my ideas. But again, we this feels like it's an opportunity to think about more broadly.",WY.10-03-2024,205,Reference
Maggie Dahn,00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.370,Hmm.,WY.10-03-2024,206,Coding
Emily Vercoe,00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.719,"Who else should be on there, and what kind of resources and roles",WY.10-03-2024,207,Coding
Maggie Dahn,00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:45.810,"And there might be some when I'm thinking there might be some that we don't check in on every month. So we imagine this being a list that we say, Hey, did you do any relational work with any of these organizations or people or programs this month? And like, let's go through each. And what were those interactions looking at like the purpose and the outcomes of those interactions? And there might be some, though it's like it's a 1 1 time interaction really like the Funder they've funded you. Maybe you have some Funder reports that are due to people or something like that.",WY.10-03-2024,208,Coding
Maggie Dahn,00:21:45.810 --> 00:22:03.253,"But but maybe, like low interaction, whereas, like, it seems like like potentially boost. And your your connections at boost and boys and Girls Club will be more frequent interactions happening to support to support the the fellows and those programs. So",WY.10-03-2024,209,Coding
Maggie Dahn,00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:10.510,maybe we just keep a comprehensive list. But we're not checking in on everyone every single time. If that makes sense to you.,WY.10-03-2024,210,Coding

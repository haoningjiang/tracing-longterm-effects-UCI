Emily Vercoe,00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:51.280,"we're less connected to maybe the young people that are near peer mentors support so sort of to speak to your point. That might be, you know. I I think it would be a helpful way to gather data on a program that is working very successfully in their community.",WY.12-12-2024,96,Reference
Emily Vercoe,00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.959,I don't know that that would be generalizable data for our State.,WY.12-12-2024,97,Reference
Seth Corrigan,00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:03.060,"No, yeah, and that's not our intention. Our intention is to come away with learnings for how to do this work, how to get.",WY.12-12-2024,98,Reference
Emily Vercoe,00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.499,"Well, then, I think it might be wonderful to learn alongside that team. Michelle.",WY.12-12-2024,99,Reference
Michelle Sullivan,00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:17.680,"Yeah. And even also, I think, your, the high school fellows program in in Level 2, I think there is. There's",WY.12-12-2024,100,Reference
Michelle Sullivan,00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:23.789,there's a a lot to be gleaned from that experience as well.,WY.12-12-2024,101,Coding
Seth Corrigan,00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.090,Right.,WY.12-12-2024,102,Coding
Emily Vercoe,00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:34.679,And for your perspective or folks. These are 2 very different programs across our state. So they'll represent a level of sophistication in the programs,WY.12-12-2024,103,Coding
Emily Vercoe,00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:41.480,that one's just starting and one's been in running program for several years. And,WY.12-12-2024,104,Coding
Emily Vercoe,00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.590,so it might be interesting to get both sets.,WY.12-12-2024,105,Coding

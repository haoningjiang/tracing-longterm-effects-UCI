Maggie Dahn,00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:32.520,"And I can, Seth. I'm just. I don't want this to feel like you need to fit things into these categories, but I think you can know what they are without it being so obtuse about it. So I just I'm gonna put them what we have. Initially, these are not what these are what Seth has gathered from the literature, and we'll do it more officially later. But to give you a sense of some of the ways that we're going to be categorizing.",WY.01-29-2025,67,Reference
Emily Vercoe,00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.940,Cool.,WY.01-29-2025,68,Reference

Emily Vercoe,00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.460,"alright, so should we jump in with January, then December, January.",WY.01-29-2025,73,Coding
Maggie Dahn,00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:08.160,"Yeah. So just to clarify. I changed that to December, January just now. Is that what I should do, or did I move it over. Should I move it to the next column to Column K, and we start fresh.",WY.01-29-2025,74,Coding
